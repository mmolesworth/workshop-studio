      ## Knowledge Check

      Let's test your understanding with a quick quiz.

  - type: quiz
    id: sample-quiz-1
    questionType: single
    question: What function is used to parse YAML in our content service?
    hint: Think about the library we installed.
    options:
      - id: a
        text: yaml.parse()
      - id: b
        text: yaml.load()
        correct: true
      - id: c
        text: JSON.parse()
      - id: d
        text: yaml.read()
    explanation: |
      **Correct!** The `js-yaml` library provides the `yaml.load()` function 
      to parse YAML text into JavaScript objects.
